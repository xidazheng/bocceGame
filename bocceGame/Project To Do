Team Git Workflow:

1. At the start of the day, bring in the changes from Github.

2. Please check the other person's branch on Github to make sure that we're not working on the same thing.

3. Mark the section that you're currently working on. Push to your branch on Github.

4. Mark the section done when you're done. Push the changes to your branch on Github.

5. Do 2, 3, and 4 again.

6. At the end of the day, add the changes to master branch on Github.



// ONGOING WORK:
// 1. DONE - Xida - Stop the moving block when it goes off screen, so that the next block doesn't have to wait for it to stop
// 2. DONE - Xida - Change blocks to not collide with jack

// 3. DONE - Xida - Game Logic

// Score the game - get one point for each block closer to the jack than the nearest opponent block
// Stop the match at 7 points

// Overlay a target on the jack
