Team Git Workflow:

1. At the start of the day, bring in the changes from Github.

2. Please check the other person's branch on Github to make sure that we're not working on the same thing.

3. Mark the section that you're currently working on. Push to your branch on Github.

4. Mark the section done when you're done. Push the changes to your branch on Github.

5. Do 2, 3, and 4 again.

6. At the end of the day, add the changes to master branch on Github.



// ONGOING WORK:
// 1. DONE - Xida - Stop the moving block when it goes off screen, so that the next block doesn't have to wait for it to stop
// 2. DONE - Xida - Change blocks to not collide with jack

// 3. Xida - Game Logic
// DONE - Highlight the nearest ball
// Change the make block to make the color of the team that does not have the nearest ball to the jack
// Show which team is going
// Show how many balls each team has left (maximum of 4)
// Stop when all four balls have been thrown on each side

// 4. Scoring Logic
// A match is consisted of enough games for one side to reach 7 points
// Update the game score after each turn
// Score the game - get one point for each block closer to the jack than the nearest opponent block
// Stop the match at 7 points

// 4. Jack Improvements - Nice to Have
// Check to make sure that the jack is in the right range
// Overlay a target on the jack

// 5. Design Polish
// Change the blocks to circles
// Make the blocks bigger and more massive

// 6. Game Behavior Tweaking - Nice to have
// Add slight gravity during each game

// 7. Refactor into classes
